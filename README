lua-TestMore : an Unit Testing Framework
========================================

Introduction
------------

lua-TestMore is a port of the Perl5 module Test::More.

It uses the Test Anything Protocol as output,
that allows a compatibility with the Perl QA ecosystem.

It's an extensible framework.

It allows a simple and efficient way to write tests (without OO style).

Some tests could be marked as TODO or skipped.

Errors could be fully checked with error_like().

It supplies a Test Suite for Lua itself.
